Sets in python 
Bitwise operators


Bitwise operators
Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were string of binary digits. It operates bit by bit, hence the name.
USES: 
encryption, 
compression 
byte manipulation

Bitwise operators in Python
Operator	Meaning	Example
&	Bitwise AND	x & y = 0 (0000 0000)
|	Bitwise OR	x | y = 14 (0000 1110)
~	Bitwise NOT	~x = -11 (1111 0101)
^	Bitwise XOR	x ^ y = 14 (0000 1110)
>>	Bitwise right shift	x>> 2 = 2 (0000 0010)
<<	Bitwise left shift	x<< 2 = 40 (0010 1000)

Let’s take two numbers- 5 and 7. We’ll show you their binary equivalents using the function bin().
 Terminal EX:
 
 AND (&)
 >>> bin(5)
 ‘0b101’
 >>> bin(7)
 ‘0b111’
 Now let’s try applying ‘and’ and ‘&’ to 5 and 7.
 >>> 5 and 7
 7
 >>> 5&7
 5
 >>>  1.0 & 1.0 
 boom!
 
 Bitwise OR (|)
 >>>6|1
 >>>0b110|0b001
 
 Bitwise XOR (^) 
 >>>6^6
 >>>6^0
 >>>0b110^0b011
 
 Bitwise 1’s Complement (~)
 >>>~2
 >>>bin(~5)
 
 Bitwise Left-Shift Operator (<<)
  True has an equivalent integer value of 1. If we shift it by two places to the left, we get 100. This is binary for 4.
  In the table below: Let x = 10 (0000 1010 in binary) and y = 4 (0000 0100 in binary)

get integer type with base 2
>>>bin(10) 
Out[174]: '0b1010'
>>>int('1010', 2) 

Interview Questions on bitwise operators 
1. Do multiplication using bit wise operators
 x*9  = 9x
 (x <<3) + X = 9x

2. Set right most bit: 2 ways
x ^ ( x & (x-1)) 
x & (-x) 
 x = 10 = (1010)2
 (-x) is the two's complement of x
 (-x) will be equal to one’s complement of x plus 1
 so  (-x) = 0101 + 1 = (0110)2
 x & (-x) = (1010)2 & (0110)2 = (0010)2

3.  x | (1 << n) : Returns the number x with the nth bit set.

Sets: unordered collections of unique elements.
Why sets??
 membership testing, 
 removing duplicates from a sequence, 
 computing standard math operations on sets such as 
    intersection, 
    union, 
    difference, 
    symmetric difference.

class sets.Set([iterable])

#dict can have uniq keys so as set
set_dict = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(set_dict)

# use set with set constructor
Lets dig through sets class in the class... 
https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html

# Python program to demonstrate differences
# between normal and frozen set
 
# Same as {"a", "b","c"}
normal_set = set(["a", "b","c"])
 
# Adding an element to normal set is fine
normal_set.add("d")
 
print("Normal Set")
print(normal_set)
 
# A frozen set
frozen_set = frozenset(["e", "f", "g"])
 
print("Frozen Set")
print(frozen_set)
 
# Uncommenting below line would cause error as
# we are trying to add element to a frozen set
# frozen_set.add("h")


Operation	
len(s)	 	
 number of elements in set s (cardinality)
x in s	 	
 test x for membership in s
x not in s	 	
 test x for non-membership in s
s.issubset(t)	
 s <= t	test whether every element in s is in t
s.issuperset(t)	
 s >= t	test whether every element in t is in s
s.union(t)	
 s | t	new set with elements from both s and t
s.intersection(t)	
 s & t	new set with elements common to s and t
s.difference(t)	
 s - t	new set with elements in s but not in t
s.symmetric_difference(t)	
 s ^ t	new set with elements in either s or t but not both
s.copy()	 	
 new set with a shallow copy of s

s.update(t)	
 s |= t	return set s with elements added from t
s.intersection_update(t)	
 s &= t	return set s keeping only elements also found in t
s.difference_update(t)	
 s -= t	return set s after removing elements found in t
s.symmetric_difference_update(t)	
 s ^= t	return set s with elements from s or t but not both
s.add(x)	 	
 add element x to set s
s.remove(x)	 	
 remove x from set s; raises KeyError if not present
s.discard(x)	 	
 removes x from set s if present
s.pop()	 	
 remove and return an arbitrary element from s; raises KeyError if empty
s.clear()	 	
remove all elements from set s

Lets go n do some examples 

Python Data Structures – Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
Summary
https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-data-structures-tutorial/


 set1 = {10, 10, 20, 50, 30, 2, 2, 78, 87, 90, 20, 78}
 from collections import OrderedDict
 
 Convert array into dictionary data structure using 
OrderedDict.fromkeys(iterable) function, 
it converts any iterable into dictionary having elements 
as Key in the same order they appeared in array.
Now iterate through complete dictionary and print keys.

HW:
1. Generate all the possible subsets of a set ?
Consider a set A of 3 elements.
A = {a, b, c}

Now, we need 3 bits, one bit for each element.
1 represent that the corresponding element is present in the subset, 
whereas 0 represent the corresponding element is not in the subset. 
Let’s write all the possible combination of these 3 bits.

0 = (000)2 = {}
1 = (001)2 = {c}
2 = (010)2 = {b}
3 = (011)2 = {b, c}
4 = (100)2 = {a}
5 = (101)2 = {a, c}
6 = (110)2 = {a, b}
7 = (111)2 = {a, b, c}

Pseudo Code:

possibleSubsets(A, N):
    for i = 0 to 2^N:
        for j = 0 to N:
            if jth bit is set in i:
                print A[j]
        print ‘\n’
